# (void \*)OS

## Building
### Prerequisites
* Rust nightly. I'm using the December 5, 2018 version, but others MAY work. I make no guarantees for them, though.
* Xargo. The most recent available version should work.
* A GCC cross-compiler for the i686 architecture.
* Qemu, specifically `qemu-system-i386`.

Once all these things are set up, just type `make` and `(void *)OS` should start automatically.
